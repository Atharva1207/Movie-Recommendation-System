# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project builds three types of movie recommendation systems using the MovieLens dataset:
1. **Popularity-Based**: Recommends top N movies in a specified genre with a minimum number of reviews.
2. **Content-Based**: Suggests movies similar to a given movie based on genres.
3. **Collaborative-Based**: Recommends movies based on preferences of K similar users to a target user.

# Data
- **Movies.csv**: Movie IDs, titles, genres.
- **Ratings.csv**: User IDs, movie IDs, ratings, timestamps.

#Steps
1. Load and explore the data.
2. Build and evaluate the recommendation models.
3. Optional: Use a GUI for interactive recommendations.
